# The `go-nvlib` project

This respository holds a collection of go packages to ease the development of
NVIDIA GPU management software. Many of its abstractions build and expand upon
the base [`go-nvml`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/go-nvml) package which provides
a comprehensive wrapper around the official [NVIDIA Management
Library](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/nvml-api/index.html).
